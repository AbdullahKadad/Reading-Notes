## Relational Databases and SQL

1. **Relational Database Concepts:**

   - Understanding of relational database management systems (RDBMS).
   - Knowledge of tables, rows, and columns.
   - Primary keys, foreign keys, and relationships between tables.
   - Normalization techniques to reduce data redundancy and improve data integrity.

2. **Structured Query Language (SQL):**

   - **Data Definition Language (DDL):** Creating, altering, and dropping database objects like tables, indexes, and views.
   - **Data Manipulation Language (DML):** Querying and modifying data in the database using commands like SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE.
   - **Data Control Language (DCL):** Managing user access privileges with commands like GRANT and REVOKE.
   - **Data Query Language (DQL):** Retrieving data from one or more tables using SELECT statements.

3. **SQL Joins:**

   - Understanding different types of joins such as INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, and FULL JOIN.
   - Utilizing join conditions to retrieve data from multiple related tables.

4. **Aggregate Functions:**

   - Using functions like SUM(), AVG(), COUNT(), MIN(), and MAX() to perform calculations on groups of rows.

5. **Subqueries and Derived Tables:**

   - Understanding subqueries and their role in SQL queries.
   - Utilizing subqueries within SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE statements.
   - Employing derived tables (also known as inline views or subquery factoring) for complex data processing.

6. **Indexes and Optimization:**

   - Creating and managing indexes to improve query performance.
   - Understanding query optimization techniques such as indexing strategies, query rewriting, and query execution plans.

7. **Transactions and Concurrency Control:**

   - Understanding ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) and their importance in database transactions.
   - Implementing concurrency control mechanisms such as locking and transactions isolation levels.

8. **Data Integrity Constraints:**

   - Using constraints like NOT NULL, UNIQUE, PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY, and CHECK to enforce data integrity rules.

9. **Views and Stored Procedures:**

   - Creating and managing views for virtual tables based on SQL queries.
   - Developing stored procedures for encapsulating and executing sets of SQL statements.

10. **Normalization and Database Design:**

    - Understanding normalization forms (1NF, 2NF, 3NF, BCNF) and their application in database design.
    - Designing efficient database schemas to minimize redundancy and improve data integrity.

11. **Backup and Recovery:**

    - Implementing backup strategies to safeguard against data loss.
    - Understanding recovery techniques to restore databases in case of failures.

12. **Security:**
    - Managing user access control through authentication and authorization mechanisms.
    - Implementing security measures to protect against SQL injection attacks and unauthorized access.
